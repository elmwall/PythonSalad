# A Python Side Salad

This is a repository is simply for various problem solving and Python practice. There are repetitive tasks that pop up in digital work with a lot of flinging about that somehow feels unnecessary yet unavoidable. So this makes something creative out of an aggravating thing, just to say "hah, no more of that", sometimes growing into bigger projects or insights.


## Current Salad Content 

### Image processing tool

Script: [*image_processing.py*](https://github.com/elmwall/PythonSalad/blob/main/Tools/image_processing.py)

This tool can either crop a series of images or convert them to PNG or JPEG format. It saves the modified images in a new subfolder.

#### Motivation

I often take screenshots for auto-save and want to adjust them later. Instead of doing it to each manually, this script can crop all of them using pixel coordinates, or convert them to JPEG to save space, in batch.

#### Outcome

- Nothing original, but I will use of this tool; many softwares don't have the thing I need, while others are needlessly complex or slow. 
- There's a drawback, that one has to determine the pixels for cropping. It's most useful for a batch of images, otherwise why not use Paint. I'm working on creating various presets for screens and easier selection of screen areas.



### Site kit

Script: [*site_kit.py*](https://github.com/elmwall/PythonSalad/blob/main/Tools/site_kit.py)

This is a script enabling automatic running/opening a set of softwares and web pages.

#### Motivation

While working on a project or hobby where I repetitivel has to open a number of pages or programs waving my mouse around the screen before I can get going. This tools assists in putting up a work kit and tools - a limited set, opening too many or too taxing might not be wise. I'll include a delay option further on.

#### Outcome

- Simple, but I find it quite convenient. One entry instead of multiple interactions.



### Word count

Script: [*word_count.py*](https://github.com/elmwall/PythonSalad/blob/main/Tools/word_count.py)

This script is for counting lines, words, and characters in a text file.

#### Motivation

Just a silly thing. I was lacking a word count function in a word processor and felt unreasonably annoyed, so I made one.

#### Outcome

A tiny thing, but I'll use it again.
